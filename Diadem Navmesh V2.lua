    ************************
   
    Version Notes:
    0.0.1.22 ->    -Added more routes.
                       -> One additional 8 node loop for miner, two additional 16 node loops for miner.(4 miner routes now, RedRoute is default route)
                       -> One additional 8 node loop for botanist, two additional 16 node loops for botanist.(4 botanist routes now)
                   -Added GP reserve setting to allow Bountiful Yield II spam to not affect +5 node Buffs set as true by default,
                   -Modified script to enable ability to set class to route chosen if on wrong class when script started
                       -> Need to enable and have Botanist and Miner gearsets
                   -Added mob_table to detour to island murderfields for a specific mob you want to focus if it is not found while gathering ; fixed name of Diadem Biast to Diadem Beast
                       -> When aether bar sets designated value in settings it will detour to the mob island spot and unload all bars
                       -> Will still kill mob if encountered while gathering
                   -Added Revisit Proc check, so buffs reapply if revisit procs on umbral node or +5 gathering nodes
                   -Added option to gather umbral nodes (all), it will swap to the appropriate class and only go once enough GP is available for buffs selected
                       -> Need to have Botanist and Miner gearsets
                       -> umbral nodes you don't want should be able to be commented out with a -- before the table entry to skip that node or nodes
                       -> will only gather umbral node once per weather then return to farming unless PrioritizeUmbrals set to true.
                   -Added buff options for umbral node gathering, as well as options to conserve GP if gathering umbrals and umbral weather detected
                   -Class check will now occur based on assigned route if node isn't found before exiting duty to reset.
    0.0.1.21 ->    Update for snd version click changes.
    0.0.1.20 ->    Update for DT changed the /click talk to /click  Talk_Click.
    0.0.1.19.2 ->  More Pandora settings added to count for user error if you have Auto-interact with Gathering Nodes and Auto-Mount after Gathering they are disabled now.
    0.0.1.19.1 ->  Now you don't need to configure plugin options i got you ;D
    0.0.1.19 ->    Anti stutter now configurable for gathering loops.
    0.0.1.18.4 ->  Added a option to not use aether cannon , New option anti stutter added Tweaked some of the killing logic.
    0.0.1.18.3 ->  Fixed the 4.node of PinkRoute Hopefully fixed the rare accurance of not getting in diadem again
    0.0.1.18.2 ->  Litle fix for jumping before nodes and fixed the automation
    0.0.1.18 ->    Some automation Bug fixes, safeties added in places (missing a node in a loop will reset the instance)
    0.0.1.17 ->    Now it will go to other nodes and continue if the target you were trying to kill got stolen(yea i know we already fixed it once)
    0.0.1.16 ->    Fixed the rare getting stuck after killing mobs issue. (this time it is a real fix)
    0.0.1.15 ->    . . . This hasn't been miner edition for awhile. NAME CHANGED
    0.0.1.14 ->    (Man I thought I would of been done with this) Made a "CapGP" setting. If you want it to spend GP before you get to cap, change this to false. (this will use YieldII)
    0.0.1.13 ->    Targeting system has been overhauled on the mob kill side, now it SHOULD only target the mobs you want to target. (this also means you can edit the table and remove which mobs you ONLY want to target.)
    0.0.1.12 ->    Switched over the debug to output to XlLog under "Info" this cleans up chat a lot, but also has it in a neat place for us to track where things might of broke
    0.0.1.11 ->    Partially fixed the getting stuck after killing mobs fixed the dismount problem that made you fall down infinitely
    0.0.1.10 ->    New node targeting fixes spawn island aether current fix 
    0.0.1.8  ->    Tweaked the Node targeting should work better and look more human now.
    0.0.1.7  ->    Fixed the nvamesh getting stuck at ground while running path. Added target selection options Twekaed with eather use if you unselect the target or somehow it dies script will contuniue to gather.
    0.0.1.6  ->    Pink Route for btn is live! After some minor code tweaking and standardizing tables. 
    0.0.1.5  ->    Fixed Job checking not working properly
    0.0.1.4  ->    Fixed Gift1 not popping up when it should 
    0.0.1.2  ->    Fixed the waiting if there is no enemy in target distance now script will contuniue path till there is one and Aether use looks more human now
    0.0.1.0  ->    Man... didn't tink I'd hit this with how big this was getting and the bugs I/We created in turn xD 
                  This is the complete version of this script for now. I'm afraid if i change up the codebase anymore, then it's going to break. XD So going to push this as a released version, then focus on re-factoring the code in a different script (with blackjack and hookers)
                  Main things is:
                    -> Red Route is up and running 
                    -> Aethercannon is online and functional (and doesn't crash)
                    -> Ability to select which node your going to hit in the settings (don't be a dumb dumb and set it to where it'll try and gather something outside your gathering range, it won't')
                    -> Ability to ACTUALLY use the proper GP skills on the +10 integ node as well so you can maxamize on getting your items
                    -> Vnavmesh also fixed the pathing issue in v31, so that's also to a point where I feel comfortable releasing this with the "AllIslands" route. 
                  Thank you @UcanPatates with the help on this. I look foward to us making this the best diadem script we can in lua, then maybe translate that into a plugin in itself. 

    ***************
    * Description *
    ***************

    (What was suppose to be a leveling script xD) 
    A SND Lua script that allows you to loop through and maximize the amount of points that you can get in a timespan. 
    This includes (but limited to)
        -> Aethercannon Usage 
        -> Fully Automated Gathering 
        -> Using skills on the proper node 
        -> More dynamic pathing (to hopefully prevent everyone looking as botty)

    PLEASE. CHANGE. SETTINGS. As necessary
